Wow, okay, just walked out of Fountain of Youth and my brain is just... it's mashed potatoes right now. The lights in the hallway were way too bright after sitting in the dark for so long, felt like a mole dragged into a disco, you know? So, anyway, the  , yeah, it was just... explosion of colors, occasionally, like they threw a paint factory against a wall and 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮ed it in slow motion.

> Honestly, the plot kinda felt like trying to untangle headphones. There's this old wizard-looking dude, but like cooler because he's wearing sneakers. He somehow controls time or youth or both? Kinda fuzzy on that. The scenes kept cutting between this ancient rainforest and a futuristic city where everything was too shiny, my eyes hurt, like staring at a thousand fresh snowflakes.

The part where the tiger turned into a cloud, though? What was that even about? For real. I couldn't stop thinking, Did I drop my popcorn, or did the tiger just vaporize? Speaking of, there's still popcorn crumbs all over me, like I'm some humanoid buttered corn creature. And my back... my back feels like I carried the entire soundtrack on it. Too many explosions. Or maybe that’s how youth feels? Exploding :)

Wait, so yeah, opening scene, there’s this kid painting ancient symbols on a wall, and it made me think of programming. Like, who programs the script of life? Mind-blowing when you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   unfold.

Someone mentioned 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   afterward, but honestly, not sure if my brain could handle a second round. And at some point, those whispers in the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 made me paranoid, kept turning around expecting to see... I dunno, my lost youth wearing aviators?

Anyway, if you haven't 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 the  ... well, you're missing a blender of emotions. Slight anxiety mixed with awe and a sprinkle of confusion. But hey, there's always a way to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for later, if you dare.

Back to juggling thoughts now, like spilling jigsaw pieces all over the sidewalk. Movies, man... sometimes they feel too big, like trying to fit the universe in a phone booth.
